This application is a number sorter which sorts all the numbers in ascending order... It is designed in a way which makes it easy to use and the design is similar to a calculator.

>It consists of buttons with values (0-9), All clear, Backspace and comma.
>It supports input from both mouse and keyboard (Mouse can be used to click on buttons designed on the sorter to give input data or the user can use their keyboard to enter the data onto display).
>The values are sorted only when comma is used in-between to seperate each input value.

<?>Note: It is compulsory to use comma in-between input data for correct output to be displayed.
